# ✈️ Airline Data Analysis (Python Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing airline data using Python.  
The notebook explores trends, patterns, and insights related to airline operations such as **passenger statistics, flight delays, cancellations, revenue, and other key metrics**.  

The analysis helps in understanding:
- Airline performance
- Passenger trends
- Delay & cancellation patterns
- Factors affecting airline operations  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack / Tools Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation & cleaning  
- **NumPy** – numerical calculations  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive analysis

## 🔑 Key Features
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Statistical analysis of airline performance  
- Visualizations of passenger trends, delays, and cancellations  
- Correlation analysis of various airline factors  
- Insights and recommendations  

---

## 📊 Sample Visualizations
- Flight delays by airline  
- Passenger traffic over time  
- Cancellations by reason  
- Revenue trends

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/airline-data-analysis.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd airline-data-analysis
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook "python airline project 1.ipynb"
📌 Future Improvements
Build an interactive dashboard (Power BI / Streamlit)
